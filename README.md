# NYC_Taxi_Fare_Price_Prediction
PG-DBDA Project

Welcome to Machine Learning Taxi Fare Price Prediction Project! 

We have developed a web interface for end user to predict the fare 
amount for a taxi ride in New York City on giving the time, number of passenger, pickup and 
drop-off locations. Predicting fare can help passengers decide when is the optimal time to start 
their commute, or help drivers decide which of the potential rides will be more profitable.

For this Project, we have worked on kaggle dataset of about 5 crores rows, link to dataset is given below-
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data?select=train.csv

Main steps for this machine Learning Project - 
1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing 
2. Machine Learning model building 
3. User Interface using Streamlit API
4. AWS cloud Deployment

User Interface is as below- 
User can add desired locations, date and time and then on clicking on predict button application can predict the fare price for that trip.
